# WHIZ POS v2.0 - Project Progress Report

This document outlines the current state of the WHIZ POS v2.0 project and the defined end goal.

---

## 1. Current State (As of 2025-10-24)

The project is currently in a transitional phase, moving from an initial Node.js/Express prototype to a more robust, scalable architecture based on the "WHIZ POS — COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION BLUEPRINT".

The repository contains two parallel applications:

### a) The Original Express.js Application (Legacy)

This is the initial application where the redirect bug was discovered.

*   **Location:** `src/`, `public/`
*   **Tech Stack:** Node.js, Express, EJS, client-side JavaScript.
*   **Status:** Partially functional. The core logic for user login and basic dashboard views exists, but it was plagued by authentication and redirect issues. It should be considered **deprecated** and will be fully replaced by the new architecture.
*   **How to Run:**
    1.  `npm install` (from the root directory)
    2.  `npm start`
    3.  The server runs on `http://localhost:3000`.

### b) The New NestJS Application (Foundation)

This is the foundational scaffolding for the new, blueprint-defined architecture.

*   **Location:** `server/`, `shared/`
*   **Tech Stack:** TypeScript, NestJS.
*   **Status:** Functional Core. The NestJS server is now a functional application with a database connection and real authentication. The desktop app has a working UI for the core sales loop.
*   **Key Progress:**
    *   **Database Integration:** The NestJS server is connected to MongoDB, with modules for `Users`, `Products`, and `Transactions`.
    *   **Real Authentication:** The `POST /auth/pin-login` endpoint now validates against the database and issues a real JWT.
    *   **Core Sales Loop:** The desktop app now features a `PosTerminal` UI that can fetch products from the server, build a cart, and submit a final transaction to be saved in the database.
    *   **Test Data:** A seeder script is available to populate the database with a test user and sample products.
    *   **Device Linking:** The desktop app now has a first-time setup screen to link the device to a business using an API key. The server has a mock endpoint to handle this.
    *   **UI/UX Enhancements:** The desktop app now features a professional persistent layout for the POS view, a "Show/Hide" toggle for the PIN entry, and uses SweetAlert2 for improved user feedback.
    *   **Super Admin Foundation:** A temporary Super Admin UI has been added to the desktop app to allow for the creation of new businesses and the issuing of API keys, as specified in the blueprint. The corresponding server endpoints have been implemented.
*   **How to Run:**
    1.  `cd server`
    2.  `npm install`
    3.  `npm run start:dev`
    4.  The server runs on `http://localhost:4001`.

### c) The New Desktop POS Application

*   **Location:** `desktop/`
*   **Tech Stack:** Electron, Svelte, Vite, TypeScript
*   **Status:** Core UI and functionality are in place. The application can connect to the NestJS server, perform PIN-based login, and process sales.
*   **Key Progress:**
    *   **Device Setup:** A `DeviceSetup.svelte` component guides the user through the initial API key entry.
    *   **Login:** A `PinLogin.svelte` component handles user authentication.
    *   **POS Terminal:** A `PosTerminal.svelte` component provides the main interface for cashiers.
    *   **Super Admin:** A `SuperAdmin.svelte` component provides a temporary UI for managing businesses and API keys.
*   **How to Run:**
    1.  `cd desktop`
    2.  `npm install`
    3.  `npm run dev`

## 3. End Goal: Complete Implementation Blueprint

The ultimate goal is to fully implement the "WHIZ POS — COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION BLUEPRINT". This involves building out a complete, production-ready system with the following key characteristics:

*   **Full Monorepo Implementation:** All directories (`admin-web`, `portal`, `server`, `desktop`, `mobile`) will contain fully functional applications.
*   **Tech Stack:** TypeScript, SvelteKit (for web), NestJS (for servers), Electron (for desktop), and Capacitor (for mobile).
*   **Architecture:** A hybrid cloud/local system. Each business will run its own **Business Local Server** (the NestJS app in `/server`), which will handle local POS operations and sync with the central **Whiz Cloud Services** (`/portal`).
*   **Authentication:** A robust JWT and API key-based system.
*   **Offline-First:** All POS applications will work seamlessly offline by communicating with the local server, which will queue and sync data to the cloud when an internet connection is available.
*   **Database:** MongoDB for the local server, and MongoDB Atlas for the central cloud services.
*   **Features:** The full feature set as described in the blueprint, including user management, transaction processing, device linking, printing, backups, and more.

The next steps will involve progressively building out the features of the new NestJS server and the other applications in the monorepo, eventually phasing out the legacy Express.js application entirely.
