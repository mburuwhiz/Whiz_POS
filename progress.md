# WHIZ POS v2.0 - Project Progress

This document tracks the development progress of the WHIZ POS v2.0 system, focusing on the Business Local Server component.

## Current State (As of 2025-10-23)

We have successfully completed the foundational setup for the **Business Local Server**. The work done so far provides a solid, scalable starting point for building the application's features.

### Key Milestones Achieved:

1.  **NestJS Application Scaffolding:**
    *   A new NestJS project has been created in the `server/` directory.
    *   The project includes a standard structure with `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and a comprehensive `.gitignore`.
    *   All initial dependencies have been installed.
    *   The application is configured to be **environment-driven**, reading settings like the server port from a `.env` file, which aligns with production-ready best practices.

2.  **API Specification (OpenAPI):**
    *   A formal API contract has been defined in `docs/api-spec.yaml`.
    *   This OpenAPI 3.0 specification details all core endpoints, request/response schemas, and authentication methods (`PIN-based` and `Admin`).
    *   This document serves as the single source of truth for communication between the server, POS clients, and the cloud portal.

3.  **Database Integration and Models:**
    *   The server application is now connected to a MongoDB database.
    *   The connection is securely configured using the `MONGO_URI` environment variable.
    *   Mongoose schemas have been implemented for all core data models as defined in the API specification:
        *   `User`: For employees, managers, and administrators.
        *   `Business`: To store business-specific information and configuration.
        *   `Transaction`: For sales records.
        *   `Device`: For POS terminals linked to a business.

## End Goal

The end goal is to deliver a fully functional **Business Local Server** as specified in the "WHIZ POS v2.0" blueprint. This server is a critical component of the hybrid architecture, designed to operate both online and offline.

### Expected Core Features:

*   **Robust Authentication:** Securely handle user logins via both 4-digit PINs (for POS users) and email/password (for Business Admins).
*   **Device Management:** A secure flow for linking new POS devices to a business using a one-time API key.
*   **Transaction Processing:** Reliably record and store all sales transactions from connected POS devices.
*   **Offline First Functionality:** The server must queue all transactions and other critical data locally.
*   **Cloud Synchronization:** Periodically sync queued data (transactions, etc.) with the central Whiz Cloud Services when an internet connection is available.
*   **Printing Services:** Handle requests from POS clients to print receipts on locally connected printers (USB, network, etc.).
*   **API Implementation:** Expose a complete and correct API that aligns with the `api-spec.yaml` definition.

Upon completion, the Business Local Server will be a self-contained, reliable, and production-ready application that serves as the central hub for all in-store POS operations.
