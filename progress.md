# WHIZ POS v2.0 - Project Progress Report

This document outlines the current state of the WHIZ POS v2.0 project and the defined end goal.

---

## 1. Current State (As of 2025-10-24)

The project has a solid foundation with a functional NestJS server and a desktop application capable of handling the core sales loop. The legacy Express.js application is now fully deprecated.

**Current Focus:** Implementing advanced payment options as part of Phase 2. This includes adding support for "Credit" payments (with end-of-day settlement) and integrating the M-Pesa mobile money service.

### a) The New NestJS Application (Foundation)

*   **Location:** `server/`, `shared/`
*   **Tech Stack:** TypeScript, NestJS.
*   **Status:** Functional Core. The server supports database integration, user authentication, and basic transaction processing.
*   **How to Run:**
    1.  `cd server`
    2.  `npm install`
    3.  `npm run start:dev`
    4.  The server runs on `http://localhost:4001`.

### b) The New Desktop POS Application

*   **Location:** `desktop/`
*   **Tech Stack:** Electron, Svelte, Vite, TypeScript
*   **Status:** Core UI and functionality are in place. The application connects to the server, handles PIN login, and processes basic sales.
*   **How to Run:**
    1.  `cd desktop`
    2.  `npm install`
    3.  `npm run dev`

## 3. End Goal: Complete Implementation Blueprint

The ultimate goal is to fully implement the "WHIZ POS â€” COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION BLUEPRINT". This involves building out a complete, production-ready system with the following key characteristics:

*   **Full Monorepo Implementation:** All directories (`admin-web`, `portal`, `server`, `desktop`, `mobile`) will contain fully functional applications.
*   **Tech Stack:** TypeScript, SvelteKit (for web), NestJS (for servers), Electron (for desktop), and Capacitor (for mobile).
*   **Architecture:** A hybrid cloud/local system. Each business will run its own **Business Local Server** (the NestJS app in `/server`), which will handle local POS operations and sync with the central **Whiz Cloud Services** (`/portal`).
*   **Features:** The full feature set as described in the blueprint.

The next steps will involve progressively building out the features of the new NestJS server and the other applications in the monorepo.
