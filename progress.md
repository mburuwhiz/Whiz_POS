# WHIZ POS v2.0 - Project Progress Report

This document outlines the current state of the WHIZ POS v2.0 project and the defined end goal.

## 1. Current State (As of 2025-10-24)

The project has a solid foundation with a functional NestJS server, a feature-rich desktop application, and the beginnings of a cloud portal for administration.

**Current Focus:** Building out the Whiz Cloud Portal and enhancing the core POS features.

### a) NestJS Server (Business Local Server)

*   **Status:** Core functionality is robust. The server supports:
    *   User and Business management with a full CRUD API.
    *   Advanced payment processing for Cash, Card, Credit, and M-Pesa.
    *   End-of-day credit settlement and sales summary generation.
    *   Automatic, server-side receipt printing (simulated as text files).
    *   API key lifecycle management (issuance and activation).

### b) Desktop POS Application

*   **Status:** Most core cashier and manager features are implemented.
    *   **Sales:** Full sales flow with support for all payment methods.
    *   **Management:** Screens for Product Management, Credit Settlement, and viewing the End of Day Summary are complete and integrated.
    *   **Device Linking:** The initial one-time device linking flow is functional.

### c) SvelteKit Portal (Whiz Cloud Portal)

*   **Status:** Foundation is in place.
    *   A new SvelteKit application has been created in the `portal/` directory.
    *   Super Admins can log in securely.
    *   A business management dashboard allows admins to view all businesses, register new ones, and manage their API key lifecycle (issuance and activation).
